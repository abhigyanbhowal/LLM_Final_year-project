\f0\fs24 \cf0 The EU AI Act aims to regulate the development and use of artificial intelligence systems within the European Union. It classifies AI systems into risk categories: unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal.\
\
High-risk systems, such as those used in law enforcement or employment, must comply with strict requirements:\
- Risk assessment and mitigation\
- Data governance and quality\
- Human oversight\
\
The act also bans AI systems that manipulate human behavior or exploit vulnerabilities of individuals.\
