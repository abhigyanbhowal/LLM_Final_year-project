Cell‑by‑cell summary

Cell 0 — NLTK resources
Downloads NLTK components used by METEOR/tokenization:

wordnet, omw-1.4 (synonym mapping for METEOR),
punkt (sentence/word tokenization).
Why: METEOR and tokenization require these corpora to run deterministically.

Cell 1 — Package install (datasets)
pip install datasets for Hugging Face Datasets (used later by LegalBench runner).

Why: Enables load_dataset(...) when evaluating benchmark tasks.

Cell 2 — Imports (NLP, metrics, plotting, utilities)
Consolidates dependencies:

General: os, time, random, pandas
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Metrics: sacrebleu.BLEU, nltk tokenizers, nltk.translate.meteor_score.single_meteor_score,
ROUGE utilities, sentence_transformers (SentenceTransformer, util) for BERTScore
Torch (for embeddings), and related helpers
Why: Sets up all tooling for scoring (ROUGE/METEOR/BERTScore/F1/EM/optional BLEU) and visualization.

Cell 3 — Model client setup (OpenAI)
Initializes an OpenAI client for GPT‑4o calls.

Note: API key is instantiated here. In production, you should load it from environment variables (e.g., os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]) rather than embedding secrets in code.
Why: Provides the proprietary model adapter for pipeline runs.

Cell 4 — Utility (!pwd)
Prints current working directory (likely for debugging paths).

Cell 5 — Data declarations: legal sources & queries
Defines the core inputs:

LEGAL_DOCS: mapping of file names to on‑disk paths (e.g., ai_act_regulation.txt, data_retention_policy.txt).
QUERIES: list of TXT‑based questions per document (e.g., obligations for high‑risk AI providers; banned AI systems; classification).
(Later cells also define) CSV_QUERIES: list of CSV‑driven clause/compliance questions with a reference answer per query.
REFERENCE_ANSWERS: short gold reference strings for metrics.
Why: Centralizes the corpus and evaluation prompts used throughout.

Cell 6 — Core pipeline helpers (retrieval, prompts, model calls)
Implements the key building blocks:

documents = {name: open(path).read() ...}
Loads TXT sources into memory.
retrieve_context(query, document, top_k=3)
Uses a SentenceTransformer to embed the query and document segments, then util.semantic_search to pull top‑k relevant passages.
Why: Supplying focused context improves answer quality and reduces hallucination.
build_prompt(query, context, strategy)
Constructs the final prompt according to strategy:
Few‑Shot: adds a couple of Q→A exemplars, then the query + context.
ReAct: scaffolds Thought → Action → Observation → Answer to elicit stepwise reasoning.
Tree‑of‑Thought (ToT): asks the model to explore multiple reasoning branches and then consolidate.
Why: Strategy‑aware prompting is central to your study.
get_model_response(model_name, prompt) (and/or load_and_run_model)
Normalizes calls to GPT‑4o / Claude / Open‑source endpoints and measures latency (start/stop timing).
Why: Creates a uniform interface across proprietary/open models and logs response time, which matters for legal practice.
Cell 7 — Text normalization + scoring
Implements the evaluation logic:

normalize_text(text): lowercases, strips, removes punctuation for fairer string comparisons.
evaluate(response, reference): computes the full metric set:
Exact Match (EM): strict match after normalization (binary).
F1: token‑level precision/recall harmonic mean (robust to partial overlap).
ROUGE: n‑gram/sequence overlap (summary fidelity).
METEOR: synonym‑aware matching (uses WordNet).
BERTScore: semantic similarity via transformer embeddings (highly relevant for legal paraphrase).
(Optional) BLEU: included for completeness (less emphasized for paraphrase‑heavy legal text).
Returns a consolidated dict of metric scores.
Why: Quantifies both surface‑level and semantic alignment + supports classification‑style scoring.

Cell 8 — run_legalbench(...)
A runner specifically for LegalBench‑style tasks:

Uses datasets.load_dataset to fetch a designated split.
Iterates over examples, applies your chosen strategies, calls models, and records metrics + latency into results.
Why: Adds a standard benchmark flavor to complement TXT/CSV custom datasets.

Cell 9 — run_pipeline() (main orchestrator)
The core experiment loop for your TXT/CSV datasets:

Iterate over models × strategies × queries.
For TXT: retrieve_context → build_prompt → get_model_response.
For CSV: usually templates the row context (or selected columns) → prompt → response.
evaluate(response, reference) to gather EM, F1, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore and latency.
Append a long‑format record for each (model, strategy, source, query).
Output: returns a pandas DataFrame with per‑query rows (full log).

Cell 10 — summarize_results(df)
Groups/aggregates the long log:

Computes means (and sometimes std) for each metric by Model × Strategy × Source (TXT/CSV/LegalBench).
Returns a tidy summary table for reporting and plotting.
Why: Produces the tables that feed your Results section and slide figures.

Cell 11 — visualize_metrics(df)
Creates comparison plots across models/strategies/sources (e.g., FacetGrid with seaborn):

Metric‑wise bar charts (ROUGE/METEOR/BERTScore/EM/F1)
Often “hue = Model”, columns/rows for Strategy and Source
Why: Quick, consistent visual diagnostics of trade‑offs (e.g., ToT semantic gains vs latency cost).

Note: In pure reproducible scripts, you might export figures via plt.savefig(...). In this notebook, the visualizer focuses on on‑screen plots.
Cell 12 — error_analysis(df)
Prints/inspects lowest‑scoring examples (e.g., by F1): shows the query, model response, and possibly the reference.

Why: Helpful to understand failure modes (e.g., hallucinations, misread CSV fields, truncation).

Cell 13 — __main__ block (full pipeline + LegalBench split)
Runs the full TXT/CSV pipeline:

df_full = run_pipeline()
Optionally filters LegalBench subset: df_legalbench = df_full[df_full["Source"] == "LegalBench"]
Exports CSV results (e.g., llm_eval_legalbench_results.csv)
Why: Provides a single‑cell “run everything & save” entry point.

Cell 14 — Install LegalBench (editable)
pip install -e legalbench for local benchmark integration.

Cell 15 — __main__ block (LegalBench‑only)
Minimal entry point to:

Define models = ["gpt-4o", "claude-3-opus", ...], strategies = ["few_shot", "react", "tree_of_thought"]
run_legalbench(models, strategies, results)
Create a DataFrame and save to (e.g.) legalbench_only_results.csv
Why: Lets you run LegalBench without the rest of the corpus.

Cell 16 — (repeat) Install LegalBench
Duplicated pip install -e legalbench (safe but redundant).

Cell 17 — (empty/placeholder)
Reserved for future additions.

What the pipeline produces

Per‑query logs with: Model, Strategy, Source (TXT/CSV/LegalBench), Query, Response, EM, F1, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore, Latency (s)
Summaries aggregated by Model × Strategy × Source
CSV exports:
llm_eval_legalbench_results.csv (from full run with filter)
legalbench_only_results.csv (from benchmark‑only run)
Visuals (inline): metric comparison charts per strategy/source (optionally saved if you add savefig)
How Ashurst’s needs are reflected

Latency is measured per call → critical for live legal workflows.
Strategy scaffolds (ReAct/ToT) add traceable reasoning, aligning with reviewability requirements.
CSV handling mirrors real compliance trackers and obligation matrices.
Error analysis cell supports audits by surfacing concrete failure cases.
